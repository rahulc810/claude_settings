# Forge

Turns raw ideas into skill decisions. For each idea it models the strongest version of
the skill implied, runs an internal Proposer/Skeptic debate, and renders a verdict plus
a rating. This is `notice`'s "Reviewing" step, done properly instead of skipped.

## When to use this

- `docs/skill-ideas/` has accumulated candidates and you want them triaged.
- Pointed at someone else's skill directory to assess that set.
- Skip for a one-line tweak to an existing skill — just make it.

## Procedure

1. **Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and `skills/README.md`** (the authoring
   standard, the registry, and the **Overlap check**).

2. **Resolve the scan dir** — the argument, else `docs/skill-ideas/`. `Glob` `*.md`
   (non-recursive; the `_` dirs are skipped). Note whether this is **local mode**
   (`docs/skill-ideas/`) or **external mode** (any other path). Process each file in
   order:

3. **Proposer pass** — model the strongest skill the idea implies: name, one-line
   purpose, trigger phrases, the procedure it would run, the artifact or outcome it
   produces, and the recurring need it serves. Steelman it. In external mode the input
   may already be a `SKILL.md` draft — model from that, don't reinvent it. Write this
   case into the report before starting the Skeptic pass.

4. **Skeptic pass** — assume the skill should *not* exist; make the idea earn its place.
   Attack on four axes:
   - **Overlap** — apply the Overlap check against every `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Name any
     skill it duplicates or heavily shares discipline with.
   - **Realness** — is the need recurring or a one-off? Cite evidence: `docs/notice.md`,
     `git log`, the idea file itself.
   - **Skill-shaped** — is this a reusable *procedure*, or a preference / fact /
     one-time task that belongs in memory or `CLAUDE.md`?
   - **Context cost** — does an always-loaded `description` for this pay for itself?

5. **Synthesis** — reconcile the two passes, citing named Proposer and Skeptic points
   (a named overlap must be addressed, not waved past). Apply the rule:
   - Distinctness ≤ 2 → **fold into `<existing>`** — unless Recurrence ≥ 4 *and* folding
     would push the host skill past ~120 lines, then **add**.
   - Skill-fit ≤ 2 **or** Recurrence ≤ 2 → **drop** (say which axis, and where the
     content should go instead if anywhere).
   - Otherwise → **add as new**.

6. **Rating, in principle** — score independent of the verdict (a strong idea can still
   be `fold`). Five axes, 1–5, one line of justification each:

   | Axis | 1 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|
   | Recurrence | seen once | arises weekly |
   | Distinctness | ~duplicate | no neighbour |
   | Skill-fit | belongs in memory | clearly a repeatable procedure |
   | Scope tightness | vague / broad | single crisp trigger→outcome |
   | Context cost | heavy for niche value | cheap or high-value |

7. **Write the report** to `docs/skill-ideas/_assessments/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` — one file per
   run, each idea a section: modeled skill, Proposer case, Skeptic case, verdict, rating.

8. **Act on confirm — local mode only, per item:**
   - **add** — write `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` to the authoring standard, append a
     registry row to `skills/README.md`.
   - **fold** — show the exact Edit (target skill, section, added text); apply on yes.
   - **drop** — record the reason.
   Then move every processed idea file to `docs/skill-ideas/_processed/` with the verdict
   appended. External mode stops after step 7 — report only.

## Constraints

- Proposer's full case is written to the report before the Skeptic pass begins.
- The Skeptic argues from "this should not exist"; a weak defence is a finding, not a
  pass.
- Synthesis must address every overlap the Skeptic named.
- External mode never writes outside this repo and never archives the scanned files.
- Never delete an idea file — `_processed/` only.
- Don't design the skill in depth here — `add` produces a first draft; a real design
  pass is `/designit`.

## Done criteria

- Every `*.md` in scope has a verdict and a 5-axis rating in the report.
- Confirmed `add` / `fold` actions applied; registry updated.
- Processed idea files moved to `_processed/` (local mode).
