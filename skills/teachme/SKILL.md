description: Run a closing concept-retro at the end of substantive Claude Code sessions to catch concept-gaps before they become invisible black boxes. Trigger automatically near the end of any session where you introduced a protocol, library, architecture pattern, or tool the user hadn't specified or clearly already known — even if the user doesn't ask for it. Do NOT trigger for sessions that were pure syntax lookups, small tweaks, or used only concepts already logged in concepts.md. If unsure whether a session was "substantive," lean toward running it — a skipped trivial retro costs nothing, a missed real one lets a black box slip through.

# Concept Retro

## Why this exists

The user works fast with agents and is fine delegating implementation detail — syntax, boilerplate, exact API calls. What he is NOT fine losing track of is *concepts*: protocols, architectures, libraries, or tradeoffs that got introduced into a decision without him knowing the vocabulary existed to question it. That's the actual black-box risk, distinct from "I'd have to look up the syntax myself."

This skill is the closing checkpoint that catches the second kind before it accumulates silently.

## When to run

Automatically, near the end of a session, if — and only if — the session introduced at least one concept-level thing the user likely didn't already know: a new protocol, a new library/framework, a non-obvious architecture choice, a new tool/service, a security or infra pattern, etc.

Skip it when:
- The session was pure syntax/tedium (e.g. "fix this regex", "rename these variables")
- Every concept touched is already logged in `concepts.md` (check first — see below)
- The session was trivial / very short

Don't wait to be asked. If genuinely unsure whether something counts as "new," err toward including it — better to over-log slightly than let a gap through.

## What to do

1. **Check for prior entries first.** Create a `dd-mmm-day-concept-slug.md` in `/home/rahul/databases/server-docs/concepts`. Skim existing entries so you don't re-log something already covered — if a concept reappears, that's a signal worth a short note (see step 4), not a full new entry.

2. **Identify what's new.** Review the session and list concepts, protocols, tools, or architectural choices that:
   - Weren't specified by the user
   - Aren't things you have clear evidence the user already knows
   - Are conceptual (not just unfamiliar syntax for something the user already understands)

3. **For each one, write an entry** in this format:

   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] <Concept name> — <project/repo>
   **What it is:** one or two plain-language sentences, no jargon-on-jargon.
   **Why here:** why this session/agent chose it over alternatives.
   **Alternative:** what else could have been used and the tradeoff.
   **Related concepts and Further reading:** Where do go from here.
   ```

   Keep each entry tight — a paragraph, not a tutorial. The goal is enough to recognize and reason about the term later, not to teach it from scratch.

4. **If a concept reappears** (already in the file from a prior session), instead of a full new entry, append a one-line note under the existing entry: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] came up again in <project>` — this is the signal that it's crossed from "one-off" to "worth actually learning properly."

5. **Mention it briefly to the user** at the end of your session summary — one line, e.g. "Logged 2 new concepts to concepts.md: MQTT, and the pub/sub broker pattern." Don't dump the full entries into chat; the file is the record.

## What NOT to log

- Syntax the user could look up in 10 minutes (specific function signatures, exact flag names, language features)
- Anything the user explicitly specified or clearly directed ("use MQTT" — they named it, no gap there)
- Pure implementation detail with no conceptual weight (variable naming, formatting choices)

The filter is always: *would not knowing this term stop the user from even asking the right question?* If yes, log it. If it's just "I'd have to Google the exact syntax," skip it.
